Improving Further 
======================   


Since we have analysed the data's,we still have lot of space to improve the process in dynamic way:

Improving methods:
     1.Applying machine learning algorithms to classify the ```library_transaction``` 
          [```book title```]  to a specific ```subject_code```.
     2.if we have ```exam_cell_data``` for ```batch17``` & ```batch18```,we can 
          correlate the ```Library_usage``` and ```exam_cell_data```.
     3.Deploying the project to the cloud makes ```students``` life easier to search for a book and 
          get recommendations.
