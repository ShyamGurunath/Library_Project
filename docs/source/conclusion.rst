Conclusion
================================================================

     In the below 

Concluding Hypothesis
----------------------------------------------------------------

Batch 16
---------------------------------

      Our hypothesis:
          Null Hypothesis:

               **Library usage of students has positive correlation with the 
               Academic Performance of students**.

          Alternate Hypothesis:

               **Library usage of students has negative correlation with the 
               Academic Performance of students**.

          Correlation plot of ```Library_usage``` and ```exam_cell_data```...

     Since we have negative correlation between ```library_transaction``` and 
     ```exam_cell_data```, we're are rejecting our Null Hypothesis and opting to 
     Alternate Hypothesis...

     Thus we're concluding that library_usage of a particular student is higher...
     His marks is likely to be stable or less..

Batch 17 & Batch 18
---------------------------------

     Since we have *no* ```exam_cell_data``` for ```batch17``` and ```batch18``` 
     we have a fequency plot for both batches:

     We have included the plots in the ```batch17``` & ```batch18```..
