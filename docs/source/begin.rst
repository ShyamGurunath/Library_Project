Problem Statement
------------------

  How the library usage improvises the Academic Performance?

Abstract
---------

     "Deciding our problem statement,as to analyze the relationship between Library usage and Academic Performance.
     We began to list out the process in our plan of attack."

     1. Data Collection
     2. Data Masking
     3. Data Preprocessing
     4. Data Analysis and Visualization


Literature Review
----------------------

     'Before getting our hands dirty with the data, our team decided to learn some basics 
     Data Analysis and Visualization Techniques.We started diving into python libraries
     for Data Analysis and Visualization like':
     
          1. Pandas 
          2. Numpy 
          3. Matplotlib
          4. Seaborn  

     .. warning:: So learning all these gave us the idea about how to work with data,
          but without Statisics and Data Science Concepts we can't move forward with
          Analysing..As our next step we learned core concepts of Statisics and Data Science
          Concepts as suggested by Suresh sir.

     We got a chance of meeting our project guide twice a week..
     On every Wednesday Session he shared us some important concepts and ideas to work around the project..
     And on every Saturday Session we shared our progress of the week and worked our skillset with him..


Where we started?... 
----------------------------------------------------------------

     .. note::  One of the main asset of Data Analysis is Data Collection Process,
               that's where we started.


     `We started looking for all possible data's within our campus premises..`
     
     And we shorlisted to the below datasets...



     * Blink Automation 
     * Course Feedback
     * Geek-Dino Tab usage
     * Library Transaction records 
     * Exam-cell data


     We started to discuss within the team where we would like to make progress 
     in the campus premises that will be benificial to both students and management..

     Then with the help of mentors we ended
     up choosing the Library Transaction records and Exam-cell data.

Hypothesis
-------------

     
     .. note:: To be able to Analyse a data it's necessary to determine a hypothesis.

     Our hypothesis:
          Null Hypothesis:

               **Library usage of students has positive correlation with the 
               Academic Performance of students**.

          Alternate Hypothesis:

               **Library usage of students has negative correlation with the 
               Academic Performance of students**.
